have already refunded accounts under 100k which held CASH direrctly and saber cash/usdc LP and saber cash/ust LP.

the inntention was only to take money from those who do not need it, not from those who do. will be using the eth gains to return more funds to those affected, even some accounts more than 100k. will not return funds to accounts that already receive refund.

instructions: we want jimthereaper#6550 and The Saint Eclectic#1238 to leads the organization. they have shown to be leaders. for each person affected the following exact information is required for us to consider return of funds.

1. eth address to send the returned funds to. all returns will be done in eth.
2. the original solana wallet that held the cash or cash lp pair. even cash lp pairs that we did not take (like PAI/CASH or aeMIM/CASH) will be return since it is our fault they lost money to arbitage bots.
3. if the lp is held by other owner (like sunny or quarry) then a transaction proving that you own the lp and the account that you own is needed. this message will have to be signed by the account that you own instead of account that directly owns the lp (since that will be sunny or quarry).
4. if already sell or buy lp or cash, show transaction from before the hack to prove how much you had.
5. the amount of money to be return.
6. an explanation of the source of this money and why you need it back. more detail is better. money will not be refund to rich american and european that don't need it.

all this information MUST be signed by either the original account owner of cash or lp or the account that staked the money into sunny or quarry (like this https://docs.phantom.app
/integrating/signing-a-message). bad sign or incomplete information will result in no return. we will choose who gets a return. might get all back or some back or none back. put all the request together in one file, returns will start next week manually. will take some time.

also godoflight and all other are scammer. only trust message signed by account.`
